# PROJECT 1 PROPOSAL

## 1. High Concept

STEAM-BOT BLITZ is a quick-time event simulator featuring a defective steam golem trying to live an idyllic life in the hills, whilst being disturbed by various distractions like bears and bees. Being on such a limited engine, the game will be extremely simple, with the player having to input buttons as prompted in a certain amount of time before losing, progressively getting harder as the game progresses.

## 2. Genre

The game most closely resembles an action genre. While this genre is broad, the game itself does not quite fit into any established categories. It's possible you could consider it a quick-time game.

## 3. Platform

The game is being developed for the PC but based upon its relatively simple scope and design, it could easily be ported to mobile devices.

## 4. Story

The game follows a defective steam-bot that developed human emotions and fled to the country-side for a life of peace. Unfortunately for him, the hill country isn't a place that allows one to relax all the time. The golem must perform tasks to ward off invaders who try to ruin his peace and quiet every day.

## 5. Aesthetics

The game is planned to have a very cartoonish style, resembling a cell-shaded games like Wind-Waker and Borderlands.

## 6. Gameplay

The gameplay involves various quick-time events that the player has to perform within a certain time frame to avoid losing. For example, the game will begin and the player is instructed to mash a certain key. Upon successfully completing an event, they are provided another challenge, such as spelling a word. These prompts will continue until the player fails or runs out the clock.

## 8. Developer

My name is Samuel Carr and obviously I study Game design and Development at RIT. What about the droid attack on the wookies?

## Process for Designing the Site

The process for designing the website began by mapping the content. I initially drafted what I wanted the proposal for the game to be, thinking about the color palette and what location the game would be set in. It was also important to consider how complex the game would be, as that would effect the complexity of the website layout. Upon deciding what my final content would consist of, I mapped out th layout on paper and looking into ways I could use CSS to make it happen.

## Project Requirements

To meet the project requirements for the style declarations I specified the CSS for the header, footer, body, h1, h2, h3, p, and img to name a few. The HTML structure tags like header, nav, footer, and section are utilized to divide the pages. To fulfill the class and id selector requirements I used altered the #navigation and #main for the ID selectors and the .nav-image for the class selector. The site also uses responsive design to stack the navigation for when the width goes below 480px.
